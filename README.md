my project ia called CAPSTONE PROJECT
It is a bus reservation system created with c language
It is a basic c program where one can be able to book a ticket for a trip.
the project entails different funtions
the functions include;
1. function to add a new bus
2. function to delete a bus
3. funtion to view bus schedule
4. function to search a bus (using source and ddestination)
5. function book a seat
6. funtion to cancel a ticket
7. function to store and  view all booking history

to run this program one is supposed to put a specific username and passwaord so as to acess the menu, incorrect username and password will not be able to acess the menu
One must acess the menu for any other operation to be carried out.
